    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My partner and I are both taking Art 101. We love programming. We also love to write about ourselves. This is a great opportunity for us to combine our interests! On another note, we are excited to get good grades and pass the class. This is our ideal situation.</p>
    <div id="test"> What else is there to say? I don't know but I guess I should keep writing. Ok, last sentence. </div>
